Avoid conversions in cycles
stdbool.h for bool


explicit typing = we always annotate data with types
implicit typing
Python = strong dynamic typing ( no implicit conversions, 1 if True else "3" + 2 is ok )
JavaScript = weak dynamic typing
C = static weak typing ( all types are known in compile time, type checking during compile time )
OCaml = static strong typing
