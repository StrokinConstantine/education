2^16 bytes = segment ( in real mode ).
In real mode: physical address = segment base * 16 + offset ( segment:offset <-> 4a40:0002, ds:0001, 7db3:ah ).
When the program is loaded, the loaders sets ip, cs, ss and sp.
CPU always starts in real mode, and then the main loader usually executes the code to explicitly switch it to protected mode and then to the long mode.
In protected mode linear address = segment base ( taken from GDT ) + offset, each segment registers stores segment selector, containing an index in descriptor table. GDTR is a register that stores GDT address and size.
CISC ( Complete Instruction Set Computer ), RISC ( Reduced Instruction Set Computer ) architecture.
