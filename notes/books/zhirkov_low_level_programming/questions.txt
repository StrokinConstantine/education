Question 11. What does instruction xor rdi, rdi do?
	This instruction efficiently zero out a register rdi.
	
Question 12. What is the program return code?
	Program returns value stored in rdi, in our case program returns zero, that means program has finished without errors.
	
Question 13. What is the first argument of the exit system call?
	The first argument of the exit system call is the exit code in rdi register.

Question 14. Check that the ASCII codes mentioned in the last example are correct.
	The ASCII code of '4' is 52 = 0x34, the ASCII code of 'a' is 97 = 0x61, so all mentioned codes are correct.

Question 45. Decipher this segment selector: 0x08.
	0x08 = 0000 0000 0000 1000; T = 0 selects GDT instead of LDT; RPL = 00, it means that we are in the most priveleged level, the ring 0; Index of the descriptor in GDT = 1.
