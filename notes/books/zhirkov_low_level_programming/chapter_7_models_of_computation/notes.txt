In finite state machines, there is no memory, no assignments, no if-then-else constructions. This is thus a completely different abstract machine comparing to the von Neumann's.
There is only states and transitions.
else-rule.
This model is not Turing complete.

Regular expressions are a way to encode finite automatons.

A regular expression R can be:
	1. A letter.
	2. A sequence of two regular expressions: R Q.
	3. Metasymbols ^ and $, matching against the beginning and the end of the line.
	4. A pair of grouping parenteses with a regular expression inside: (R)
