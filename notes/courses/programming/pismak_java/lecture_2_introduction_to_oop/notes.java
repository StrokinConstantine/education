/*
Programming paradigms:
	* procedural programming
	* automata-based programming
	* event-driven programming
	* functional programming
	* object-oriented programming
	* logic programming

Object = fields + methods
Default field values: 0, false, null
Instance of the class
Constructors
Operator "new" allocates memory for class fields
UML Class Diagram
Packages
Classpath
You do not need import when you have only one package
import java.lang.*
OOP principles:
	* inheritance ( @Override )
	* encapsulation
	* polymorphism

public, protected, private, default -> classes, methods, fields, constructors
private = only in the class
protected = in the class, in the same package and in the inheritors
Default constructor
Classes can be public
this and super ( call constructor from another constructor or method )
Reference type VS Object type ( when you call a method by reference, a method will be called on a object in memory )
